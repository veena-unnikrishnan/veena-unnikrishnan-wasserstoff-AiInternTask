Internship Task: Domain-Specific PDF Summarization & Keyword Extraction Pipeline**

**Objective**:

Design and implement a dynamic pipeline that processes multiple PDF documents from a desktop folder, generates **domain-specific** summaries and keywords, and stores them in a **MongoDB database**. The system must efficiently handle documents of varying lengths, from short to long, and update the database with summary and keyword data after each document is processed.



**Task Details**

1. **PDF Ingestion & Parsing**

- **Requirement**: The pipeline should be able to process multiple PDFs from a folder on the desktop. It must handle documents of **varying lengths**:
    - Short PDFs 
    - Medium PDFs 
    - Long PDFs 
  
- **Concurrency**: Ensure the system can process multiple documents in parallel, managing system resources efficiently. The pipeline must handle large files and high volumes without crashing.

2. **MongoDB Dataset Storage & JSON Updates**

- **Initial Storage**: When each PDF is ingested, its metadata (document name, path, size, etc.) must be stored in a MongoDB collection.
- **Post-Processing Update**: After summarization and keyword extraction, the MongoDB entry for each document must be updated with the JSON output, including the generated summary and extracted keywords.

3. **Summarization & Keyword Extraction**

- **Summarization**: Dynamically generate summaries that are relevant to the domain you have chosen. The summary length and detail should correspond to the document length (e.g., a detailed summary for long documents, concise summaries for short ones).
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extract **non-generic**, domain-specific keywords that reflect key ideas or themes of the document. Avoid common or irrelevant keywords.

4. **JSON Structure & MongoDB Updates**

- **JSON Format**: Summaries and keywords must be formatted in JSON, which will then be stored in the MongoDB document. Make sure to handle updates efficiently after processing each document.
- **Error Handling**: Log any errors (e.g., for corrupted PDFs or unsupported formats) and ensure that MongoDB records are not affected by such issues.

5. **Concurrency & Performance**

- **Concurrency**: The pipeline should be designed to handle multiple documents simultaneously, leveraging parallel processing to improve speed.
- **Performance**: Provide data on how well the system scales, especially in terms of how quickly it processes large and multiple PDFs concurrently.



**Additional Requirements**


- **Document Variety**: The pipeline must handle PDFs of varying lengths. Provide examples of short (1-2 pages), medium (10-12 pages), and long (30+ pages) documents in your testing.
- **Framework Restrictions**: The use of pre-built libraries or frameworks (such as Langchain or others) is permitted, but doing so will result in a deduction of up to **15 points**. Custom solutions will receive higher marks.
- **Testing & Performance**: You are expected to provide test results, especially regarding performance metrics such as concurrency, memory usage, and processing speed.
- **Error Handling**: Handle all edge cases, such as corrupted or encrypted PDFs, without interrupting the pipeline. All errors should be logged and MongoDB records updated accordingly.



**Submission Guidelines**


- **Codebase**: Submit a well-commented and structured codebase.
- **Documentation**: Provide a `README.md` file that includes setup instructions, system requirements, and an explanation of your solution.
- **Testing**: Include unit tests and performance benchmarks to validate the efficiency and accuracy of your system.
- **Optional Docker Setup**: If possible, include a Docker configuration for simplified deployment. Bonus points will be awarded for this.
- **Performance Reports**: Attach metrics showing concurrency, speed, and resource utilization.



**Important Notes**

- **Pre-built Libraries**: Use of pre-built libraries (e.g., Langchain) is allowed but will result in a deduction of up to **15 marks**. Custom-built solutions will be rewarded more highly.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Ensure keywords are **domain-specific** and relevant. Generic or overly broad keywords will result in a deduction.
- **Document Variety**: Ensure that your pipeline dynamically adjusts for short, medium, and long documents, adapting the summarization and keyword extraction accordingly.
